* I am presently working as a <b>Assistant Professor</b> at National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur. Prior to it, I was working as Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at IIT Delhi with Prof Rijju Rekha Sen.
* My research primarily focuses on Efficient Deep Learning, developing algorithms for efficient execution at edge, and exploring potential of edge GPUs.
* I am part of the [SecVisor Reading Group](http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~kumarsandeep/secvisor/) at IIT Delhi.
